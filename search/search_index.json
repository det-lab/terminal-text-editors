They definitely have their advantages over their GUI-based counterparts, such as being less memory intensive, more ubiquitous, and more efficient for experienced users, but their advantages are often outweighed by the entry-level useability of coding environments such as Visual Studio Code for more basic applications. </p> <p>In general, it's recommended to avoid terminal-based text editors unless you have to use them. There are a few times when command-line editing will pop-up automatically, but for the most part these can be rerouted to use GUI editors as well. For instance, here is a tutorial for running SSH from Visual Studio Code, and here's another one for making Visual Studio Code your default git editor (although you can also avoid being in an editor for git by using an application such as Github Desktop or by using the command <code>git commit -m \"commit message here\"</code>).</p> <p>All that being said: when utilized to their fullest, text editors can streamline several tasks in ways that GUIs would struggle to match. In this lesson, we're going to go over the bare-bones basics of terminal-based text editors for the three most common options: <code>Vim</code>, <code>Emacs</code>, and <code>nano</code>, with short instructions for each on how to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Open a file,</p> </li> <li> <p>Edit or insert text into a file,</p> </li> <li> <p>Save a file and keep your changes,</p> </li> <li> <p>Close a file and/or discard your changes, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Search for text within a file.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"01_introduction/#choosing-an-editor","title":"Choosing an editor","text":"<p>When selecting an editor, the right choice for you will depend on your needs, experience level, and editing habits:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>nano</code> is best for beginners or quick edits, with a simple interface that includes helpful commands at the bottom of the screen. If you're only intending on changing a config file or writing a short script without learning many commands, <code>nano</code> is ideal. </p> </li> <li> <p><code>Vim</code> offers speed and precision for experienced users.
